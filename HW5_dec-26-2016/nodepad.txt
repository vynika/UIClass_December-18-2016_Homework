3. What are semantic elements?
A. Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.

Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
 A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer">
to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>

4. Difference between article and section?
A.  article:
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

Forum post
Blog post
Newspaper article

section:

The <section> element defines a section in a document.

According to W3C's HTML5 documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."

A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

An HTML form contains form elements.

Form elements are different types of input elements, like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more.

Form validation:
HTML form validation can be done by JavaScript..

If a form field (fname) is empty, this function alerts a message, and returns false, to prevent the form from being submitted.
